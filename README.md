# work-day-planner

This repository contains a simple planner application that displays a row for every hour between 5 am to 11pm. In each row, users can input things that they desire to complete around that time, and they can save the input, which will persist through refreshes. 

Certain rows are colored grey (in the past) and green (in the future) and one row will be red to signify the current hour. 

The repository uses javascript to populate the entire page with rows of hours, and to handle all the events that happen on screen.
